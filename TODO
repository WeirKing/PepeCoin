Convert the miner to a class based system. This not really necessary but probably a good idea

Mining should be implemented parallel to handling client/miner communications

Change the transaction framework to be entirely based on a hash table rather than a linked list. 
Create a framework for mining a new pepecoin


Separate the console interface and the backend network handling into separate threads.


Gotta get the crypto working so the signature doesn't incresae the size of the hash. 
Get the basic console working
	load a key from supplied file (also load default key from file on startup)
	Store and load the available transactions to a private key.
	Generate a transaction.
