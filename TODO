Convert the miner to a class based system. This not really necessary but probably a good idea

Mining should be implemented parallel to handling client/miner communications

Change the transaction framework to be entirely based on a hash table rather than a linked list. 
Create a framework for mining a new pepecoin


Separate the console interface and the backend network handling into separate threads.

TODO Decide whether transactions should have a linked list or not. I really don't know if transactions should have a reference to their previous transaction or not. Definitely not next transaction but maybe previous transaction ://///


Gotta get the crypto working so the signature doesn't incresae the size of the hash. 
Get the basic console working
	load a key from supplied file (also load default key from file on startup)
	Store and load the available transactions to a private key.
	Generate a transaction.
